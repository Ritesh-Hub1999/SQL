-> What is a database?

A database is a structured collection of
data that can be easily accessed, managed,
and updated. It allows for the storage and
retrieval of data in an organized manner.

-> What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized
programming language used for managing and 
manipulating relational databases. It enables
you to execute queries, retrieve data, insert 
records, update records, delete records, and 
manage database schemas.

-> What are the different types of databases?

Relational Databases: Store data in tables
with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).

NoSQL Databases: Store data in formats other than tables,
such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or 
wide-columns (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis).

-> Explain the difference between a database and a DBMS.

A database is a collection of data organized for
storage, accessibility, and retrieval. A Database
Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts
with the database, users, and other applications to
capture and analyze data.

-> What is a primary key?

A primary key is a unique identifier for
a record in a table. It must contain unique
values and cannot contain NULL values.

-> What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in
one table that uniquely identifies a row of another 
table. It establishes a link between the data in the
two tables.

-> What is normalization? Explain its different forms.

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a
database to reduce redundancy and improve data 
integrity. The different normal forms include:

1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values and each record is unique.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Meets all requirements of 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): Meets all requirements of 2NF and all attributes are only dependent on the primary key.
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): A stronger version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

-> What are ACID properties?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a 
transaction are completed; if not, the
transaction is aborted.

Consistency: Ensures that the database remains in a consistent
state before and after the transaction.

Isolation: Ensures that transactions are executed
independently without interference.

Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed,
it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

-> What is indexing? Why is it used?

Indexing is a database optimization technique that
allows for faster retrieval of records from a table.
It creates a data structure (index) that improves the
speed of data retrieval operations on a database table
at the cost of additional storage space and slower write operations.

-> What are joins in SQL? Explain different types of joins.

Joins are SQL operations used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of joins include:

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the left table and 
the matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the left
table are included with NULL values for columns from the right table.

RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the right table
and the matched records from the left table. Unmatched records from the
right table are included with NULL values for columns from the left table.

FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns records when there is a match in 
either left or right table. It returns NULL for columns that have
no match in either table.

CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables,
combining each row of the first table with each row of the second table.

-> What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP commands?

DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. 
Can be rolled back and triggers can be fired.

TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, but the table 
structure and its columns, constraints, indexes, etc., 
remain. Cannot be rolled back and triggers are not fired.

DROP: Removes the table definition and its data, indexes, 
constraints, and triggers permanently from the database. 
Cannot be rolled back.

-> Explain the concept of a transaction.

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations 
treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that all 
operations within the transaction are completed successfully
before committing changes to the database. If any operation
fails, the transaction is rolled back to its previous state.

-> What is a stored procedure?

A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one
or more SQL statements stored in the database. It can 
be executed as needed to perform a specific task, such 
as modifying data or returning data, which improves 
performance and security.

->hat are triggers?

Triggers are special types of stored procedures that 
automatically execute (or "trigger") in response to 
certain events on a particular table or view, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

-> What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?

Clustered Index: Determines the physical order of data in a table. 
Each table can have only one clustered index, and it is used for 
primary key constraints.

Non-Clustered Index: Does not alter the physical order of data. 
It creates a separate object within the table that points back to
the original table rows after searching. Tables can have 
multiple non-clustered indexes.

-> What are views in SQL?

A view is a virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query. 
It can contain data from one or more tables and can be used to 
simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access
to certain data, and present data in a specific format.

-> What is the difference between a UNION and a JOIN?

UNION: Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. It removes duplicate records unless UNION ALL is used.
JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

->Explain the concept of normalization with examples.

1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures each column contains atomic values and each record is unique.
Example: A table where each column contains only one value per cell.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Meets all 1NF requirements and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
Example: A table where each non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): Meets all 2NF requirements and all attributes are only dependent on the primary key.
Example: A table where non-key columns are not dependent on each other.

->What are aggregate functions in SQL?

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include:
COUNT(): Returns the number of rows in a set.
SUM(): Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
AVG(): Returns the average value of a numeric column.
MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a set.
MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a set.
